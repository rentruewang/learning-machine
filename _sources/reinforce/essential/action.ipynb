    "Action is usually the output of the agent (that is modelled by a deep learning function). If the function is a classifier, then the action would be an integer showing which action to take. If the function is a regression model, then the action is merely the value of the output. Really, what an action is depends on how it is used, and anything can be considered an action so long as it makes the state change to a new one."
