    "See the difference? Transfer learning is used when you want to _transfer_ the knowledge of a model over to another model, while domain adaptation is used when you want to _adapt_ a model to what it has never seen before. Transfer learning is about keeping what a model knows, and domain adaptation is more about making a model work in a new environment.\n",
