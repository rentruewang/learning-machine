    "Actor critic sounds cool, but it's nothing special. Remember that policy networks outputs probability? The probability is generated by taking `softmax` (see the previous chapters about softmax), over a vector of scalars, which is usually called **logits**. Here's an interesting fact about logits: because softmax is applied on logits, adding a scalar to all the logits doesn't change the softmax output!"

    "What actor critic does is essentially this, it uses a policy network to generate logits, and uses a value network to generate a scalar. It then subtracts the scalar from the logits, and call the result **advantage**. The scalar acts similarly to the mean of logits, and although it doesn't change the output of the policy model (because the logits are eventually passed into a softmax layer), it helps reduce the variance of the model and makes the model more robust."

    "PPO is one of the most famous actor critic methods, developed by OpenAI. PPO is an offline RL optimization method.

The PPO algorithm optimizes the model in the following steps:\n",
